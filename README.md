# Student Gradebook
This program is a tool that helps keep track of student's grades. It displays a menu of options, including adding a student, updating the student's grade, and viewing the class average. 
I wrote this to demonstrate the skills I've been developing in using the Java language. Some of the skills are using classes, variables, and functions.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
Tools used to write this program:
- Visual Studio Code
- Java language

# Useful Websites
- w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
- BeginnersBook (https://beginnersbook.com/java-collections-tutorials/)

# Future Work
- I would like a cleaner display. Change the spacing and add color.
- Give the option to view the list of students when you're updating grades.
- Include options to add grades for specific assignment types. (quizzes, exams, etc.)
